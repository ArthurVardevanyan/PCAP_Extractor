This is a raw fron end code.
I have the Code Inserted into https://github.com/shevabam/ezservermonitor-web on my machine to make it look a lot nicer.


ALSO WIP
I am Using https://datatables.net/ so the tables look nice and provide complex searching and organization of the data.

Very much a WIP, being able to manipulate the MYSQL Data through the Website.
